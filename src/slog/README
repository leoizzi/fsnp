This file is taken from the slog library (https://github.com/kala13x/slog).

I've slightly modified the library for styling and performance reason.
In particular:
    - I've added some macros for specifying the level
    - The file is no longer opened and closed every time is made a log, instead
      is opened with slog_init and closed with a new function called slog_close.
    -The compilation uses CMake instead of make
